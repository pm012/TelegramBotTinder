Help a man write his first message to a girl.
It should not be too long, bright, interesting and intriguing. Add emoticons.
Write a ready-made version of the message right away, which can be sent without templates and signatures.
The next message will contain some information about the girl herself (you do not need to directly refer to this information, just use it to make the message better).
